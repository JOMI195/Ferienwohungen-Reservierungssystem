# StayFinder

StayFinder is a showcase under construction for an apartment booking system for Database-Systems Classes 1 at HTWG Konstanz.

It is designed to provide a seamless experience for finding and booking apartments. The project consists of a frontend developed with React and TypeScript using a Vite server, and a backend built with a Java Grizzly server using Jersey for RESTful services (not fully implmented). The entire application is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment with Docker Compose.

## Features

- Browse available apartments
- View apartment details
- Book apartments
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
